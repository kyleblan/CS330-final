Added final project and design document


How do I approach designing software?

My approach to designing software has changed significantly as a result of this project. This application of my skills has been one of the largest in scope to date, and helped me to understand the value of documentation. Referring to technical info contained in documentation is a frequent part of the design process. 

How do I approach developing programs?

My methods are typically to research the body of work that could relate to my subject, first and foremost. This helps to establish a clear encapsulation of the program. 

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

Computerized visualizations will be a large part of my personal time spent coding in the future. I plan to expand greatly on what I have accomplished in this class just in the interest of coding interesting things in the future.
